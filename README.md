# **How to use in Krita**



**Through Filter Layers:**

1. Add Filter Layer

2. Under "Map", choose "Gradient Map"

3. Choose a map that you like, and click OK to apply the gradient map.

4. To edit the gradient map again, right click the filter layer and select "Properties"

5. You can paint on the filter layer with black and white to decide where and how much the gradient map effects the drawing. You can even give the filter layer exciting blending modes and see how those transform your colours



**Through Filters (In my experience this has a slower preview):**

1. From the top menu select "Filter", then "Map", then "Gradient Map".

2. Choose a map that you like, and click OK to apply the gradient map.
